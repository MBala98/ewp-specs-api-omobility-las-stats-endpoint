Example scenario
----------------

For clarity, the examples contain only information about courses that the student wants to attend at the receiving HEI (`components-studied`).
Attached files *are not* valid get responses or valid update requests.

* [01-initial-version.xml](01-initial-version.xml) - first proposal of the LA, already accepted by the student and the sending HEI (get response)
* [02-update-components-studied.xml](02-update-components-studied.xml) - the receiving HEI does not accept the LA and proposes some changes (update request)
* [03-second-version-get.xml](03-second-version-get.xml) - second proposal of the LA, taking into account the comments of the partner,
  already accepted by the student and the sending HEI (get response)
* [04-approve-components-studied-draft.xml](04-approve-components-studied-draft.xml) - the receiving HEI accepts the LA (update request)
* [05-signed-version-before.xml](05-signed-version-before.xml) - first version of the LA which is signed by all three parties - Table A and first version of Table A2 (get response)
* [06-changes-during-proposal.xml](06-changes-during-proposal.xml) - student wants to change one course - Table A, first version of Table A2 and proposals (get response)
* [07-approve-components-studied-draft.xml](07-approve-components-studied-draft.xml) - the receiving HEI accepts the change (update request)
* [08-changes-during-proposal.xml](08-changes-during-proposal.xml) - change applied; student wants to change two more courses - one of them added in previous change - Table A, second version of Table A2 and proposals (get response)
* [09-update-components-studied.xml](09-update-components-studied.xml)  - the receiving HEI does not accept the change (update request). This time it uses comment instead of structured suggestion.
* [10-changes-during-fixed-proposal.xml](10-changes-during-fixed-proposal.xml) - student wants to change one more course, taking into account the receiving HEI comments - Table A, second version of Table A2 and proposals (get response)
* [11-approve-components-studied-draft.xml](11-approve-components-studied-draft.xml) - the receiving HEI accepts the change (update request)
* [12-final-version.xml](12-final-version.xml) - final version of the LA, with two changes during the mobility - Table A and A2 (get response)
