Example scenario
----------------

For clarity, the examples contain only information about components and approvals.
Attached files *are not* valid get responses or valid update requests.

* [01-initial-version.part.xml](01-initial-version.part.xml) - first proposal of the LA, already accepted by the student and the sending HEI (get response)
* [02-comment-proposal.part.xml](02-comment-proposal.part.xml) - the receiving HEI does not accept the LA and proposes some changes (update request)
* [03-update-initial-version.part.xml](03-update-initial-version.part.xml) - second proposal of the LA, taking into account the comments of the partner,
  already accepted by the student and the sending HEI (get response)
* [04-approve-proposal.part.xml](04-approve-proposal.part.xml) - the receiving HEI accepts the LA (update request)
* [05-signed-first-version.part.xml](05-signed-first-version.part.xml) - first version of the LA which is signed by all three parties (get response)
* [06-changes-proposal.part.xml](06-changes-proposal.part.xml) - student wants to change one component in table A and add a component to table C (thus the "Virtual component" option will be enabled for LA) (get response)
* [07-approve-proposal.part.xml](07-approve-proposal.part.xml) - the receiving HEI accepts the change (update request)
* [08-changes-proposal.part.xml](08-changes-proposal.part.xml) - change applied; student wants to change two more components in table A (one of them added in previous change) (get response)
* [09-comment-proposal.part.xml](09-comment-proposal.part.xml) - the receiving HEI does not accept the change (update request).
* [10-changes-proposal.part.xml](10-changes-proposal.part.xml) - student wants to change one more component in table A, taking into account the receiving HEI comments (get response)
* [11-approve-proposal.part.xml](11-approve-proposal.part.xml) - the receiving HEI accepts the change (update request)
